# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

This repository presents a comprehensive collection of **end-to-end data science and analytics projects** that demonstrate how data is used to support **real business, operational, and policy decisions**. The work emphasizes not only technical execution, but also **problem formulation, data integrity, interpretability, and clear communication of insights**—the core skills required in production analytics and applied data science roles.

The projects span a range of applied domains, including **real estate and housing markets, restaurant and grocery operations, consumer behavior and segmentation, education outcomes, and public health and insurance markets**. Each project begins with raw or minimally processed data and follows an industry-aligned workflow: ingestion and validation, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and delivery through reproducible code, saved models, and interactive Tableau dashboards.

A consistent theme throughout the portfolio is **decision-oriented analytics**. Business questions are explicitly defined upfront, and analytical methods are selected based on their ability to inform action—such as pricing strategy, demand planning, customer retention, risk identification, or market assessment—rather than purely optimizing technical metrics. When machine-learning models are used, they are paired with interpretable baselines and clearly documented assumptions and tradeoffs.

## Analytical Approach & Philosophy

Across projects, the analytical approach prioritizes:
- **Data quality and structure:** building normalized relational schemas, validating keys and ranges, and separating raw ingestion from analytics-ready models  
- **Interpretability before complexity:** using regression, segmentation, and transparent features to explain outcomes before introducing more complex models  
- **Honest evaluation:** appropriate train/test or time-based validation, benchmarking, and explicit discussion of limitations or overfitting risks  
- **Business translation:** framing results in terms of revenue impact, operational efficiency, risk, and strategic insight  

This philosophy is reflected in projects that range from SQL-driven revenue and customer analytics, to time-series home value analysis, to supervised and unsupervised machine-learning models for classification, clustering, and forecasting.

## Core Capabilities Demonstrated

- **End-to-end ownership:** from schema design and ETL to modeling, validation, and dashboard delivery  
- **Applied machine learning:** linear and regularized regression, tree-based models, neural networks, clustering, PCA, classification, and benchmarking  
- **Advanced SQL analytics:** normalized and star-like schemas, analytical SQL, window functions, time-series calculations, and KPI-aligned queries  
- **Time-series & trend analysis:** growth, volatility, momentum, recovery, and forecasting across real market datasets  
- **Statistical rigor:** hypothesis testing, association analysis, effect sizes, standardized coefficients, and transparent assumptions  
- **Business intelligence:** Tableau dashboards designed for stakeholders, with metrics aligned to operational and strategic KPIs  

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **R:** tidyverse, ggplot2, randomForest, broom, and supporting statistical libraries  
- **SQL:** PostgreSQL-style SQL, relational data modeling, analytical queries, window functions  
- **BI & Visualization:** Tableau  
- **Workflow & Reproducibility:** GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, scripted ETL and validation steps  

## Repository Organization

Each project resides in its own folder and includes:
- A focused README describing the **business context, data, methods, and key results**
- Clean, well-documented analysis code (Python, R, or SQL)
- Output artifacts such as figures, tables, and saved models where applicable
- Tableau dashboards or dashboard specifications for interactive exploration

The portfolio is designed to be easily navigable, allowing reviewers to quickly assess both **technical depth** and **business reasoning**, while also providing enough detail for deeper technical review.
