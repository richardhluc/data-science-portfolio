# Data

## Source
This project uses the **Grocery Sales Dataset** from Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrexibiza/grocery-sales-dataset/data

## Availability
The full `sales.csv` file (~500MB) is not included in this repository due to
GitHub file size limitations.

## Usage
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place `sales.csv` in a local `data/`
directory to run the analysis. All data preparation steps are documented in
the code.

## Notes
Data usage is subject to the dataset’s original Kaggle license.
